# A-Novel-Framework-for-Quantifying-Player-Influence-in-Football-Using-Player-Tracking-Data

1.	Introduction

In football, understanding player influence is vital for evaluating individual performance and team strategy. Traditional metrics often overlook the nuanced interactions between players and the ball carrier. This research introduces a novel player influence model designed to quantify a player's impact on the game using detailed tracking data. By incorporating positional, speed, and direction information relative to the ball carrier, this model aims to provide a more robust framework for assessing defensive effectiveness, enhancing strategies for team management and player development.

2.	Methods

The player influence formula considers factors such as a player’s distance, speed, and orientation relative to the ball carrier. The influence metric is calculated using a Gaussian decay function, where influence decreases with distance, scales with player speed, and adjusts based on the player's directional movement. 
This formula is applied to player tracking data from the NFL Big Data Bowl 2024 dataset, spanning weeks 1-8. We assess player influence against tackle counts for validation, analyzing the relationship for all players and separately by position to verify the metric's consistency and relevance.

3.	Results

Our analysis shows a strong correlation (R² = 0.63) between cumulative player influence and the number of tackles across all positions, indicating that the metric effectively captures defensive impact.

Subgroup analysis by position further demonstrates that this correlation remains robust, with R² values exceeding 0.55 for most positions. This positional breakdown adds validity, highlighting that player influence is consistently measurable across various roles. Additionally, the metric exhibits strong stability over time, as evidenced by a persistent correlation when comparing player influence from weeks 1-4 to weeks 5-8 (R² = 0.59). This finding suggests that player influence is a reliable and repeatable measure of defensive performance.

4.	Conclusion

The player influence metric provides a meaningful and stable framework for evaluating defensive effectiveness. Its strong correlation with tackles, both overall and by position, underscores its potential utility for coaches and analysts in assessing player performance. By capturing key aspects of player positioning, speed, and direction, this metric offers a comprehensive tool for understanding defensive dynamics, contributing to strategic decision-making in team management and player development.
